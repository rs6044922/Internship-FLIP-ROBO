       "24              Dont think too much guys. perfect phone for day today use. If you are familiar with apple then go for it. camera is good which can match up with next 3 years, battery is good than all other iPhones. Definitely morning to evening-8 it can do. Display is not that bad, you will be satisfied. Best mobile worth for the money. Best for one handed issue. Very less overheating than other mobiles in market. Go for 128 gb or 256. This iphone can live upto next 3-4 years for sure. Enjoy Apple👌🏾  \n",

       "30       I’d like to start by saying that the overall experience with the iPhone 11 is super smooth and amazing in every aspect. It’s an absolute powerhouse.Performance - The Apple A13 Bionic is super optimised. You will not face any performance issue at all. You will never have to worry about the lag on this one.Battery - Battery life is one of the best you can get in a iPhone at this time. It’s better than the XR. Average use can get you more than a day and heavy use will get you through the da...  \n",
       "31  Ok, so after almost 3 years I am again back into Apple Ecosystem. Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11. Spending extra 25k just for A14 chipset and OLED display is not a clever choice. Anyways, a fantastic phone with everything fit perfectly...  \n",

Performance is up-to to the point.Face ID is extremely fast and smooth, you wont even realize you’ve unlocked your phone.FYI I’m reviewing this product after 3 months of usage because I wanted to know how the battery and other things are in this phone. So if you are thinking of buying it, Just go for it.  \n",

I understand people use apple products for years and if we consider the time span the phone is also worth for the money. But, there are also phones available under 10k and runs for years. Yes, it is true.Buy, this phone only if you want to show others how much you earn, otherwise it's nothing but just a smartphone like others are.  \n",

I had preordered iPhone 7 Plus too but that time the packaging was excellent but didn’t get the same experience this time .... hence rating it a little low.

Also mobile is delivered under 15 hrs from order.Screen is LCD but won't matter much, and little bit bulky.

Not upto the mark. We can get good android phones under this price. And really painful to buy charger and earphones, this is really con in iphones.
